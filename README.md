# Satellite-Data-Analysis
I recently explored the power of satellite data for environmental analysis using Google Earth Engine and Sentinel-2 imagery. By analyzing NDVI, EVI, and SAVI, I was able to assess vegetation cover and environmental health. This is a huge step in leveraging AI for sustainability! üåç

# Environmental Data Analysis Using Satellites

## Project Overview
In this project, I used **Google Earth Engine** and **Sentinel-2** satellite imagery to analyze environmental indicators such as **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)**, **EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index)**, and **SAVI (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index)**. This allows for understanding vegetation cover and assessing the environmental health of the region.

## What I Did
- **Satellite Data**: Utilized **Sentinel-2** imagery via **Google Earth Engine** to collect high-resolution images.
- **Indices Calculations**: Calculated **NDVI**, **EVI**, and **SAVI** to monitor vegetation health and environmental conditions.
- **Outcome**: This analysis helped evaluate how well the environment is thriving, highlighting areas for improvement in environmental protection.

## Results
- **NDVI**: 0.0309
- **EVI**: 0.0509
- **SAVI**: 0.0465

## Tools Used
- **Google Earth Engine**
- **Sentinel-2 Imagery**
- **JavaScript** for coding and data analysis

## Future Work
I plan to continue using big data technologies and **AI** to analyze environmental data and contribute to sustainable solutions.

## How to Run the Code
- Clone this repository.
- Use **Google Earth Engine** to load the dataset and apply the same analysis.
